Through research, advocacy and education, the COAZ vigorously defends the Clinical practice against scope of practice expansions that threaten patient safety Clinicians' vs Non-Clinicians Non-clinical providers such as nurse practitioners and community health assistants are an essential part of the Clinical-led care team and can help health care system and clinical practices deliver high-quality care But it is easier than ever for patients and the public to get confused about who does what in Zambia health care, and mixed up about what distinguishes the training and skill of Clinicians from those of other health professionals What’s at stake There is room for improvement in the Zambia health system but allowing non-clinicians such as nurse practitioners (NPs) or Community health practitioners to diagnose and treat patients, especially at primary health care levels and secondary health care levels without any physician oversight is a step in the wrong direction. The best way to support high-quality care and lower costs is to keep clinicians as the leader of the health care teams There is substantive evidence is diagnostic gaps. The University teaching Hospital – cancer diseases Hospital, in 2023 presented that 63% of all cancer cases received at CDH are in 63%. This shows that there is a GAP in diagnostics in Primary care sites Zambian people in underserved areas deserve better health care services. COAZ is advocating for Changes in the Human resources Establishment at all primary health care and secondary health care levels to reflect the current health care needs, especially in clinical care services Clinicians are highly trained in diagnostics. Nurse practitioners and axillary providers have a limited scope to provide comprehensive care services. They require clinical guidance from Clinicians The COAZ position Patients deserve care led by Clinicians. The most highly educated, trained and skilled health care professionals. That’s why the COAZ vigorously defends clinical care practice against scope-of-practice expansions that threaten patient safety, and it’s why fighting scope creep has become a critical component of our Health services delivery advocacy plan In addition, COAZ is aiming at Truth in Advertising campaign, that help ensure patients can answer the simple question, “Who is a Clinical Officer?”, COAZ believes that all health care professionals.

We are pleased to have received in assurance from Mr. Ankit, the Managing Director of Trooika Pharmaceuticals, regarding their ongoing support for the association.

As an association, we are both proud and excited about your timely and generous partnership. We look forward to continuing our support for the excellent products listed below. BY COAZ MEDIA. Read More Trooika Pharmaceuticals and COAZ Read More The COAZ Executive, led by the President, visited the Higher Education Authority (HEA) Director-General professor Kazhila Chinsembu. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss potential collaboration in the accreditation and registration process of higher learning institutions offering Clinical Medicine. This engagement comes in response to the increasing number of training institutions in this field, despite a noticeable decline in the quality of education, particularly in terms of skills, knowledge, and, most concerning, the attitude of graduates.We strongly urge training institutions to adhere to the recommended entry requirements as they enrol students in their programmes. Furthermore, we call on the HEA to take necessary action, including the possible closure of institutions that fail to comply with the established standards. COAZ remains committed to engaging with the HEA to ensure quality assurance in institutions offering Clinical Medicine.Jones Neba President COAZ.
