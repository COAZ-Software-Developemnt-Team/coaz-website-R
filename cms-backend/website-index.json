The purpose of the meeting was to discuss potential collaboration in the accreditation and registration process of higher learning institutions offering Clinical Medicine. This engagement comes in response to the increasing number of training institutions in this field, despite a noticeable decline in the quality of education, particularly in terms of skills, knowledge, and, most concerning, the attitude of graduates.We strongly urge training institutions to adhere to the recommended entry requirements as they enrol students in their programmes. Furthermore, we call on the HEA to take necessary action, including the possible closure of institutions that fail to comply with the established standards.

Minister of Health, Dr. E Muchima, regarding the possibility of corruption in the recent recruitment of health workers.The association sympathizes with the minister, the public, and unemployed health workers who may have been disadvantaged by such actions. We have consistently stated that the current composition of the Human Resources Committee involved in recruitment is inadequate and leaves much to be desired. It creates loopholes that could potentially champion corruption, including cronyism.Therefore, we call on the government, through the Ministry of Health and the Civil Service Commission, to disband all Human Resources Management (HRM) committees at the district and provincial levels and reconstitute them.“How can such committees be devoid of the involvement of critical civil society and professional organizations, such as ourselves and other health associations, who are the custodians of healthcare?”The decentralization policy has clearly outlined the roles of associations and civil society organizations, yet it is shocking to see us excluded at the such levels.As long as these committees remain as they are, we can expect cronyism, nepotism, bribery, and other forms of corruption to undermine our nation’s fight against such vices.We are better positioned to advise on recruitment matters, as we are represented in every district and have a deeper understanding of health-related issues. It is only in Zambia where health workers have little to no say in determining health policies.We also urge the Ministry of Health to expedite the drafting of the National Health Policy and the subsequent National Health Services Bill, as these will help address some of these challenges and contribute to the improvement of our nation’s health sector.Musonda Kamfwa, Ph.D(s) MPH MPA Secretary General Chairperson of the Committee on Health Services Clinical Officers Associatio"

This shows that there is a GAP in diagnostics in Primary care sites Zambian people in underserved areas deserve better health care services. COAZ is advocating for Changes in the Human resources Establishment at all primary health care and secondary health care levels to reflect the current health care needs, especially in clinical care services Clinicians are highly trained in diagnostics. Nurse practitioners and axillary providers have a limited scope to provide comprehensive care services. They require clinical guidance from Clinicians The COAZ position Patients deserve care led by Clinicians. The most highly educated, trained and skilled health care professionals. That’s why the COAZ vigorously defends clinical care practice against scope-of-practice expansions that threaten patient safety, and it’s why fighting scope creep has become a critical component of our Health services delivery advocacy plan In addition, COAZ is aiming at Truth in Advertising campaign, that help ensure patients can answer the simple question, “Who is a Clinical Officer?”, COAZ believes that all health care professionals. Clinicians and non-Clinical Practitioners—should be required to accurately and clearly disclose their training and qualifications to patients COAZ advocacy in action In 2023, through Ministry of Health; changed policy on regulation of Clinical Anaesthetist and ophthalmic practitioners in Zambia COAZ argued that Nursing and Mid-wifery council has no capacity and legal mandate to regulate the practice or provide monitoring in training. We stressed that only the health professions council of Zambia had such legal mandate Saw a change in regulatory mandate of the two professions given to HPCZ as submitted by the association Submitted regulatory documents for opening registers for BSc in clinical Medicine programs: mental health, Ophthalmology, Anaesthesia Advocated for creation and funding of New positions for clinical officers including senior posts such as Principal (H) and clinical care (K) positions The COAZ is pushing Pushing the Ministry of Health and HPCZ to reject implementation of inappropriate scope of practice expansions The ministry of health to develop the National standards of practice for all Health care providers in Zambia For an annual publishing of a Health workforce Mapping data by the Ministry of Health to Health in Health workforce distribution planning and recruitment Review current scope of practice for non-clinician practioners and state boundaries Establishing degree salaries for members holding bachelors degrees and more Training of MSc programs in Critical areas such as Dermatology, Cancer disease, ENT, Anaesthesia etc Creation of Bridging Programs for Medical Licentiates into MBChB and advancing into MSc Clinical Medicine programs CONTACT US info@coaz.com +260761234390 Clinical Officers Association Of Zambia P.O Box 12345 LOCATION Kapwayambale Rd, Obama WORK HOURS Week Days: 08:00 - 17:00 Copyright All Right Reserved 2024, Coaz"

April 15, 2024 Professional practice Patients in Primary Health care facilities deserve care led by Clinical practioners—the most highly educated, trained and skilled health care professionals at such levels. Through research, advocacy and education, the COAZ vigorously defends the Clinical practice against scope of practice expansions that threaten patient safety February 7, 2025 Trooika Pharmaceuticals and COAZ Another successful year has started, and COAZ Executive continues to engage with key partners. We are pleased to have received in assurance from Mr. Ankit, the Managing Director of Trooika Pharmaceuticals, regarding their ongoing support for the association. This includes providing employment opportunities to our members and assisting with our programs whenever needed. As an association, we are both proud and excited about your timely and generous partnership. We look forward to continuing our support for the excellent products listed below. BY COAZ MEDIA. February 7, 2025 Trooika Pharmaceuticals and COAZ February 4, 2025 The COAZ Executive, led by the President, visited the Higher Education Authority (HEA) Director-General professor Kazhila Chinsembu. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss potential collaboration in the accreditation and registration process of higher learning institutions offering Clinical Medicine. This engagement comes in response to the increasing number of training institutions in this field, despite a noticeable decline in the quality of education, particularly in terms of skills, knowledge, and, most concerning, the attitude of graduates.We strongly urge training institutions to adhere to the recommended entry requirements as they enrol students in their programmes. Furthermore, we call on the HEA to take necessary action, including the possible closure of institutions that fail to comply with the established standards. COAZ remains committed to engaging with the HEA to ensure quality assurance in institutions offering Clinical Medicine.Jones Neba President COAZ. February 4, 2025 COAZ is not surprised The Clinical Officers Association of Zambia - COAZ) is not surprised by the indirect admission by the Hon. Minister of Health, Dr. E Muchima, regarding the possibility of corruption in the recent recruitment of health workers.The association sympathizes with the minister, the public, and unemployed health workers who may have been disadvantaged by such actions. We have consistently stated that the current composition of the Human Resources Committee involved in recruitment is inadequate and leaves much to be desired. It creates loopholes that could potentially champion corruption, including cronyism.Therefore, we call on the government, through the Ministry of Health and the Civil Service Commission, to disband all Human Resources Management (HRM) committees at the district and provincial levels and reconstitute them.“How can such committees be devoid of the involvement of critical civil society and professional organizations, such as ourselves and other health associations, who are the custodians of healthcare?”The decentralization policy has clearly outlined the roles of associations and civil society organizations, yet it is shocking to see us excluded at the such levels.As long as these committees remain as they are, we can expect cronyism, nepotism, bribery, and other forms of corruption to undermine our nation’s fight against such vices.We are better positioned to advise on recruitment matters, as we are represented in every district and have a deeper understanding of health-related issues. It is only in Zambia where health workers have little to no say in determining health policies.We also urge the Ministry of Health to expedite the drafting of the National Health Policy and the subsequent National Health Services Bill, as these will help address some of these challenges and contribute to the improvement of our nation’s health sector.Musonda Kamfwa, Ph.D(s) MPH MPA Secretary General Chairperson of the Committee on Health Services Clinical Officers Association of Zambia.
